Title: Basketball Box Score

Description: A basketball box score if you don't know already is basically a table that contains a player's stats during the game.  I love watching basketball and always check the box score to see how certain players are performing.  So I decided to make my own version using Java (GUI).

Requirements: I suggest you download Eclipse or another IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that can run Java.  Also an example file is provided in this repository (Los Angeles Lakers.txt) that will contain the team name on the first line and player names on the following lines (keep team name and individual player names on seperate lines).
