Title: Basketball Box Score

Description: A basketball box score if you don't know already is basically a table that contains a player's stats during the game.  I love watching basketball and always check the box score to see how certain players are performing.  So I decided to make my own version using Java (GUI).

Requirements: I suggest you download Eclipse or another IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that can run Java.  Also an example file is provided in this repository (Los Angeles Lakers.txt) that will contain the team name on the first line and player names on the following lines (keep team name and individual player names on seperate lines).

Important: Download the Basketball.png file in the bin folder of this repository and add it to your bin folder if you are copy and pasting the code.  That is why the error shows up because it is trying to call the png file but it is not in the bin folder.

Important: Don't include numbers or symbols in the txt file or else there will be errors in the ComboBox.
